## Usage

### Creating your menu

```swift
import CariocaMenu

//Initialise the tableviewcontroller of the menu
let menuCtrl = self.storyboard?.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("MyMenu") as! MyMenuContentController
        
//Set the tableviewcontroller for the menu
menu = CariocaMenu(menuController: menuCtrl)

```

### Adding it to a view

```swift
menu.addInView(yourView)
```

### Boomerang

A boomerang always comes back to it's original place (in theory).
By default, the boomerang is set to `None`. It means that the menu will stay where the user let it.
The two other boomerang options are :

- `Vertical` : Will always come back at the same vertical position, but on the edge the user has chosen.
```swift
menu.boomerang = .Vertical
```

- `VerticalAndHorizontal` : Will always come back at the same position (vertical + same screen edge)
```swift
menu.boomerang = .VerticalAndHorizontal
```

## TODO

- Add a `live tutorial` to indicate users how to get the most of this menu
- Unit tests / UIAutomation Tests
- Check support for Objective-C projects
- Add emoji support instead of the menu images
- Add live background update when preselecting a menu item. The goal is to preview the preselected view before selection (with a blur effect)

## FAQ

### Why should I use `CariocaMenu`?

You're starting a new iOS app, and you want to innovate on the user experience.

### Why the name `CariocaMenu`?

I didn't want to use the same naming convention that EVERYONE uses. I could have named it `ASSuperCoolMenu`, but it sucks.
A `Carioca` is someone who lives in Rio de Janeiro. I lived there for two months, and I had this menu idea while walking on the beach üòÅ
